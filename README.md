**About DogMatch**  
DogMatch is a group project created as part of the User Interface Design course. Our goal is to help dogs find safe and loving homes and to gather the necessary support for them to lead better lives. Through our platform, users can find dogs they want to adopt or donate to support their care.

**Features**  
- **Dog Adoption:** Users can search for dogs they want to adopt and review detailed information such as their stories, health conditions, and ages.
- **Donations:** The feature allows for donations to improve the care and living conditions of the animals. Users can donate any amount they wish.
- **Adding Dogs:** Users can add dogs for adoption. Detailed information, photos, and health status of the added dogs are shared on the platform.
- **Dog Profiles:** Each dog has its own detailed profile. These profiles include information such as the dog's breed, age, health information, and adoption status.
